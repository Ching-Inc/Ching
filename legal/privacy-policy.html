            <ol type="a">
                <li>
                other Ching users (e.g., When another user sends you a payment, we may share your
                name (from your Ching profile) and profile picture (if you have one) with the other user
                to ensure the other user intends to send a payment to you. We do not share your third
                party account information or other financial information with other Ching users.);
                </li>
                <li>
                the third party mobile app you use to send or receive a transaction (e.g. when you send or
                receive money using the App, we share information with them to facilitate the
                transaction);
                </li>
                <li>
                our service providers (e.g., companies that help us provide the Ching service);
                </li>
                <li>
                law enforcement, government agencies, and other authorized third parties (we may be

        <h4>Minors’ privacy</h4>
        <p>The Ching User Service Agreement defines eligibility requirements to use the App.</p>
        <p>
            Our App is not intended for children under the age of 13. It does not knowingly collect personal
            information from children. We do not sell personal information collected from the App.
            Therefore, we would not sell information about minors.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>For information about the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), visit the
                FTC website: <a href="https://www.ftc.gov" target="_blank">www.ftc.gov</a>.</b>
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h4>Your choices</h4>
        <p>
            You can control how and when you want to receive notifications from us by following the
            instructions within the notices you receive from us and by updating your preferences in the App.
        </p>
        <p>
            You may not opt-out of administrative emails (e.g., emails about your transactions or policy
            changes) for your enrolled profile.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you use the Ching app on an iOS device, you may delete your profile by selecting “Delete
            Account” in the app settings on your device. However, doing so will immediately terminate your
            ability to use the service. Please note that simply deleting the app from your device without
            selecting “Delete Account” (via the app’s settings) will not result in your Ching profile being
            closed and deleted. If you only delete the app from your device, (without changing the app’s
            settings) you will remain a registered user and Ching will retain your data per our data retention
            policies.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h4>Updating your personal information</h4>
        <p>
            You can update your personal information at any time by accessing your profile in the App. You
            can update your User profile and registration information, including your account information
            and email addresses.
        </p>
        <p>
            If your mobile telephone number has changed, you will need to contact the company directly by
            emailing <b>support@chingtechnologies.com</b>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Keeping your profile information up-to-date is very important. If this information is incomplete,
            inaccurate, or not current, please update your information by accessing your profile in the App.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h4>Your rights regarding your personal information</h4>

                    Note: Under certain circumstances, we may not be able to delete your information
                    because we have a legal obligation or other reason that we must retain it.

            </li>
