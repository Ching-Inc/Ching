        <h4>Minors’ privacy</h4>
        The Ching User Service Agreement defines eligibility requirements to use the App.
        Our App is not intended for children under the age of 13. It does not knowingly collect personal
        information from children. We do not sell personal information collected from the App.
        Therefore, we would not sell information about minors.
        For information about the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), visit the
        FTC website: www.ftc.gov.
    </li>
    <li>
        <h4>Your choices</h4>
        You can control how and when you want to receive notifications from us by following the
        instructions within the notices you receive from us and by updating your preferences in the App.
        You may not opt-out of administrative emails (e.g., emails about your transactions or policy
        changes) for your enrolled profile.
        If you use the Ching app on an iOS device, you may delete your profile by selecting “Delete
        Account” in the app settings on your device. However, doing so will immediately terminate your
        ability to use the service. Please note that simply deleting the app from your device without
        selecting “Delete Account” (via the app’s settings) will not result in your Ching   profile being
        closed and deleted.  If you only delete the app from your device, (without changing the app’s
        settings) you will remain a registered user and Ching   will retain your data per our data retention
        policies.
    </li>
    <li>
        <h4>Updating your personal information</h4>
        You can update your personal information at any time by accessing your profile in the App. You
        can update your User profile and registration information, including your account information
        and email addresses.
        If your mobile telephone number has changed, you will need to contact the company directly by
        emailing <b>support@chingtechnologies.com</b>.
        Keeping your profile information up-to-date is very important. If this information is incomplete,
        inaccurate, or not current, please update your information by accessing your profile in the App.
    </li>
    <li>
        <h4>Your rights regarding your personal information</h4>
        We provide the Ching service pursuant to the Graham-Leach-Bliley Act (“GLBA”) and are
        exempted from certain privacy and data security laws. Even so, we honor your data privacy
        rights, regardless of whether we are obligated by law and regardless of your state of residence.
         You have the right to request a list of what personal information (if any) we’ve shared
        with third parties for their own direct marketing purposes in the preceding calendar year
        and the names and addresses of those third parties.
        o We do not share personal information with third parties for their own direct
        marketing purposes. Therefore, we have not shared personal information with
        third parties for direct marketing purposes within the last 12 months.

         You have the right to know the categories and specific pieces of personal information
        we collect, use, share, and sell about you, our business purposes for collecting personal
        information, the categories of third parties that we’ve shared personal information with,
        the categories of sources that we’ve collected personal information from, whether we’ve
        shared or sold personal information for a business purpose in the preceding 12 months,
        and the categories of third parties with which we’ve shared or sold personal information.
        o In the past 12 months, we have not shared personal information from the App in a
        manner that we consider a “sale.” For purposes of this Privacy Notice, “sale”
        means the disclosure of personal information to a third-party for monetary or
        other valuable consideration.

         You have the right to request that we delete your personal information.
        o If you use the Ching app on an iOS device, you may request to delete your data
        and close your profile by selecting “Delete Account” in the app’s settings.
        However, doing so will immediately terminate your ability to use the service.
        o Note: Under certain circumstances, we may not be able to delete your information
        because we have a legal obligation or other reason that we must retain it.
         You have the right to opt out of the sale of your personal information.
        o As stated above, we do not sell personal information that we’ve collected from the
        App.

         You have the right to be free from discrimination for exercising your privacy rights.
        o We will not discriminate against you for exercising your choices and rights.
         You have the right to access your personal information that we’ve collected about you
        in the proceeding 12 months following your request

        Please note the above-listed rights are subject to certain exceptions. For instance, we cannot
        disclose or permit access to specific pieces of personal information if the disclosure or access
        would present a certain level of risk to the security of the personal information, your account
        with us or the security of our systems or networks. We may decline your request if we cannot
        verify your identity or confirm the personal information that we maintain belongs to you. If we
        cannot honor your request, we will let you know

        security measures to protect against loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, or alteration.
        Some of the safeguards we use are firewalls, data encryption, physical access controls to our data
        centers and information access authorization controls. Additionally, we use security features that
        are built into the hardware and software of your device to help protect your transactions, such as
        facial or fingerprint recognition. We do not collect or store your biometric verification
        information when you use the App.
        It is your responsibility to make sure that your personal information is accurate and that your
        password(s) and profile registration information are secure and not shared with third-parties.
